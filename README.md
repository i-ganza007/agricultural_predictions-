## üßê Project Description <a name = "problem_statement"></a>

This project integrates relational and non-relational databases with a machine learning model to provide a RESTful API for predictive analytics. Using a structured dataset, the system enables data storage, retrieval, and real-time prediction via a FastAPI-based backend.

Key components include:

    A MySQL database with a well-designed schema (including stored procedures and triggers).

    A MongoDB database for storing unstructured or historical prediction logs.

    A machine learning model trained on the selected dataset (e.g., health, loan approval, churn, etc.).

    A FastAPI interface with CRUD endpoints to interact with the databases and invoke the prediction model.
## üí° Idea / Solution <a name = "idea"></a>

This section is used to describe potential solutions.

Once the ideal, reality, and consequences sections have been
completed, and understood, it becomes easier to provide a solution for solving the problem.

## ‚õìÔ∏è Dependencies / Limitations <a name = "limitations"></a>

1. fastapi==0.116.0

    Purpose: Core web framework for creating APIs.

    Use: Defines your routes, handles requests/responses, integrates with Pydantic for validation.

2. sqlmodel==0.0.24

    Purpose: ORM that combines Pydantic and SQLAlchemy.

    Use: Models your SQL tables and handles database queries cleanly.

3. SQLAlchemy==2.0.41

    Purpose: Underlying ORM that sqlmodel is built on.

    Use: Manages database connections, queries, transactions.

4. PyMySQL==1.1.1

    Purpose: Database driver to connect Python to MySQL.

    Use: Used internally by SQLAlchemy/SQLModel to talk to MySQL on Railway.

5. uvicorn==0.35.0

    Purpose: ASGI server to run FastAPI apps.

    Use: Launches your backend locally or in deployment.

6. pydantic==2.11.7

    Purpose: Data validation and serialization library.

    Use: Validates API input/output, used in FastAPI and SQLModel.


7. python-dotenv==1.1.1

    Purpose: Loads environment variables from a .env file.

    Use: Securely manages DB credentials and settings (like DATABASE_URL).

8. starlette==0.46.2

    Purpose: ASGI framework FastAPI is built on.

    Use: Handles lower-level HTTP and WebSocket routes, background tasks, etc.

9. h11==0.16.0

    Purpose: HTTP/1.1 protocol implementation.

    Use: Used internally by uvicorn for handling HTTP connections.

10. anyio==4.9.0

    Purpose: Async concurrency backend.

    Use: Enables async/await support in Uvicorn, Starlette, FastAPI.

11. typing_extensions==4.14.1

    Purpose: Backport of newer typing features.

    Use: Ensures compatibility with typing in older Python versions.

12. annotated-types==0.7.0

    Purpose: Support for Annotated[] in validation schemas.

    Use: Helps Pydantic with custom constraints.

13. typing-inspection==0.4.1

    Purpose: Introspects typing info.

    Use: Used by Pydantic internally.

14. pycountry==24.6.1

    Purpose: Returns country metadata (names, ISO codes, etc.).

    Use: Only needed if your app handles location-based data. If unused in your models or logic, it‚Äôs safe to remove.



## üöÄ Future Scope <a name = "future_scope"></a>

In the future, this system can be extended to serve as an agricultural decision-support tool for farmers, cooperatives, and government agencies. By integrating real-time data sources such as weather APIs, soil quality sensors, and satellite imagery, the model can predict crop yields with increasing accuracy.

## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development
and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

You need to install the above packages and frameworks specified in the  Dependencies / Limitations section . 

### Installing

```bash
cd agricultural_predictions-

cd fastapi

uvicorn main:app --reload
```
